# My first official project with Javascript
This is my second practice with Javascript (and my first official project!)

# Expense Tracker
This project is an Expense Tracker. You can put all your income and expenses and track all your savings.

# Designed with Figma
In this project, I decided to create first the Desgin and then recreate it with CSS.

# What did i learn?

In this project, I was able to understand that learning by doing is the most important aspect of software development.
Working on this expense tracker I was able to internalize all the fundamentals of Javascript and apply new concepts such as localStorage and the DOM.

About this project I will like to highlight the following:

    1. Getting and saving data with localStorage
    2. Using the DOM to change the UI dynamically
    3. Creating a design from scratch with Figma and using CSS to recreate it

# What's next ?

Keep coding and learning as always!
